# SpaceX Clone with Astro
This project is created with Astro, I use it because I want to improve the load of the page leaving all the unnecesary JavaScript and use the dinamic pages to genereate the call to the API.

## API
I was using the SpaceX unofficial API [SpaceX API]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs)https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs#rspacex-api-docs) From this API I recover the rockets and give each rocket a single page with a fetch that create dinamic pages.

## Styles
In the styles I use Tailwind, to clone almost pixel perfect the landing of SpaceX official website, and create the responsive for the website, I also include the library Tailwind animated for the animations in the page that I find so useful to create animated elements in a ease way.

## Fork repository
My project is build using **pnpm** but you can use wherever package manager that you want, you just have to delete the pnpm lock and install the package with the command of your package manager, I recommend pnpm because is more light beacuse reuses the installation of libraries.
